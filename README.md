# Green-Horizon
Green Horizon is a game about the slow and challenging transition from fossil fuels to green power sources and the fight for nature.

It features a game where you, the player, oversee the transition of a province to turn it into a green heaven.

For this you must keep the pollution at bay, build and upgrade structures to assist in the transition and explore each procedurally
generated tile for resources or clean it from harmful materials.

The goal of the game is to end pollution, while you have built and secured the province's green energy generators.

You lose if every tile of the province gets uninhabitable.
